 National Park challenge for Capital One SES

For Capital One SES Challenge, I had to create a website that connects to the national park API and shows
information about different parks. I tried using React, but quickly switched to Flask because I 
know much more python than I do JS. When deploying, Heroku kept giving an error H31, and the error 
troubleshooting docs were pretty insufficient to figure out what was wrong, so I am hosting it on 
PythonAnywhere, which worked very easily.
