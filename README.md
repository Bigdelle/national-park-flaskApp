 National Park Palooza! - Ben Bigdelle

Hello! My name is Ben Bigdelle, and I'm very excited to share my project with you all. When I first got the email that I was in the next round of the Capital One SES, I was a bit overwhelmed with the coding challenge. It seemed like it would take a lot of research, so I was worried that I wouldn't be able to balance making the website and doing school during midterm season.

However, I am very proud of what I put together. I first wanted to use React, but after playing around with it a bit, I realized that it had very similar functionality to Flask. I am much more experienced in Python and Flask than JS and React, so I decided to use flask instead. I basically handled everything through API calls in a module that I created called 'data.py', and I call all of the functions that I wrote in that class in my flask file.

In this assignment, I got a lot of experience with flask and deployment. It was amazing. I only get experiences like this when I do hackathons, so having the chance to make a project like this and get experience with github, deployment, flask, and python was very rewarding. I'm genuinely very proud of what I put together in a relatively short amount of time while also having a lot of assignments and exams to study for.
